# NewsFeed

NewsFeed is an application that gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet. The application connects to newsapi.org using
newsapi to get recent news. I also made room for category - such as business news, sport news, etc. 
Android frameworks were used to make the app userfriendly, such as:
  1. RecyclerView - to display the news feeds.
  2. Navigation Drawer - for the options/category
  3. AsyncLoader - to handle background task such as connecting to the internet and fetching newsfeeds
  4. Picasso - an external library used to handle loading of image url from the internet into an imageview.
